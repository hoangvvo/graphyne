[![PRs Welcome](https://badgen.net/badge/PRs/welcome/ff5252)](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

A **lightning-fast** JavaScript GraphQL Server, featuring:

- Caching of query validation and compilation with LRU strategy.
- Highly performant Just-In-Time compiler via [graphql-jit](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit)
- Framework-agnostic: Works out-of-the-box with most JavaScript frameworks, such as Express, Micro.

## Why

`Graphyne` uses `graphql-jit` under the hood to compile queries into optimized functions that significantly improve performance ([more than 10 times better than `graphql-js`](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit#benchmarks)). By furthur caching the compiled queries in memory using a LRU strategy, `Graphyne` manages to become lightning-fast.

## Examples

See [examples](examples).
