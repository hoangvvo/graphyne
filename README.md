[![PRs Welcome](https://badgen.net/badge/PRs/welcome/ff5252)](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

A **lightning-fast** JavaScript GraphQL Server, featuring:

- Caching of query validation and compilation with LRU strategy.
- Highly performant Just-In-Time compiler via [graphql-jit](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit).
- Lightweight, non-opinionated, and non-coupled integration with great extensibility: Does nothing more but returning handler functions to integrate into framework' routers, web workers, or [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws).

## Why

`Graphyne` uses `graphql-jit` under the hood to compile queries into optimized functions that significantly improve performance ([more than 10 times better than `graphql-js`](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit#benchmarks)). By furthur caching the compiled queries in memory using a LRU strategy, `Graphyne` manages to become lightning-fast.

## Examples

See [examples](examples).

## Packages

### Graphyne WebSocket

[![npm](https://badgen.net/npm/v/graphyne-ws)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphyne-ws)

Add WebSocket support to `graphyne-server`. Implements [GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md).

[Documentation](packages/graphyne-ws) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphyne-ws)

## Features / TODO

`Graphyne` is a work-in-progress. It is obviously not battle-tested and lack several features. My plan for now is to implement the following:

- [x] WebSocket/Subscriptions
- [ ] Persisted queries
- [ ] Federation
- [ ] Gateway

GraphQL execution layer is also bounded by the limitation of [graphql-jit](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit#differences-to-graphql-js). Yet, I have been using it in production and see no problems for my use-cases.
