Lightning-fast GraphQL Server for any JavaScript frameworks or severless environments. A package of [Graphyne](/).

## Install

Install `Graphyne Server` and `graphql` dependencies using:

```shell
npm i graphyne-server graphql
// or
yarn add graphyne-server graphql
```

If you use `deno`, pull this package from [Pika](https://www.pika.dev/npm/graphyne-server).

```javascript
import { GraphyneServer } from "https://cdn.pika.dev/graphyne-server";
```

## Usage (with bare Node HTTP Server)

```javascript
const http = require("http");
const { GraphyneServer } = require("graphyne-server");

const graphyne = new GraphyneServer(options);
// Define `options.path` if you want GraphQL to run on specific path only (such as `/graphql`)

const server = http.createServer(graphyne.createHandler());

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at :3000`);
});
```

If you do not use Node HTTP Server (which is likely), you must define `options.onRequest` and `options.onResponse`. See [framework-specific integration](#framework-specific-integration). Some frameworks are supported out of the box.

## API

### `new GraphyneServer(options)`

Constructing a Graphyne GraphQL server. It accepts the following options:

| options | description | default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| schema | A `GraphQLSchema` instance. It can be created using `makeExecutableSchema` from [graphql-tools](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools). | (required) |
| context | An object or function called to creates a context shared across resolvers per request. The function signature is the same to the framework's [handler function](#framework-specific-integration). | `{}` |
| rootValue | A value or function called with the parsed `Document` that creates the root value passed to the GraphQL executor. | `{}` |
| formatError | An optional function which will be used to format any errors from GraphQL execution result. | [`formatError`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/error/formatError.js) |
| path | Specify a path for the GraphQL endpoint, and `graphyne-server` will response with `404` elsewhere. You **should not** set this when using with frameworks with built-in routers (such as `express`, `fastify`, etc.). | `undefined` (run on all paths) |
| onRequest | Used to integrate to frameworks other than Node.js HTTP. See [Framework-specific integration](https://github.com/hoangvvo/graphyne#framework-specific-integration). | `([req, res], done) => done(req)` |
| onResponse | Used to integrate to frameworks other than Node.js HTTP. See [Framework-specific integration](https://github.com/hoangvvo/graphyne#framework-specific-integration). | `(result, req, res) => res.writeHead(result.status, result.headers).end(result.body)` |

### `GraphyneServer#createHandler()`

Create a handler for HTTP server.

### `GraphyneServer#graphql({ source, contextValue, variableValues, operationName })`

Execute the GraphQL query with:

- `source` (string): The request query string to be executed.
- `contextValue` (object): the context value that will get passed to resolve functions.
- `variablesValues` (object): the variables object that will be used in the executor.
- `operationName` (string): The operation to be run if `source` contains multiple operations.

The function returns a never-rejected promise of the execution result, which is an object of `data` and `errors`.

**Warning:**

- `errors` is not formatted using `options.formatError`. (A future version may provide a flag to do so)
- `options.context` does not run here. You need to supply the context object to `contextValue`.

## Framework-specific integration

**Handler function** refers to framework/runtimes-specific handler of incoming request. For example, in `Express.js`, it is [`(req, res, next)`](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html). In `Fastify`, it is [`(request, reply)`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Routes/). In `Hapi`, it is [`(request, h)`](https://hapi.dev/tutorials/routing/?lang=en_US#-methods). In `AWS Lambda`, it is [`(event, context, callback)`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html). In `Micro` or `Node HTTP Server`, it is simply `(req, res)`.

By default, `graphyne-server` expects the `Node HTTP Server` listener/handler function of `(req, res)`. However, as seen above, frameworks/runtimes like Hapi or AWS Lambda do not follow the convention. In such cases, `onRequest` and `onResponse` must be defined when calling `new GraphyneServer`.

See the [Integration examples](#integration-examples) section below to learn how `onRequest` and `onResponse` are used.

### `onRequest(args, done)`

This is the function to resolve frameworks with handler functions differing to `(req, res)`. It will be called with `args`, an array of *arguments* from a framework's handler function, and a callback function `done` to be called with one of the two:

- `req`: `IncomingMessage` from Node.js
- A compatible request object (See section below)

By default, `onRequest` assumes `request` is the fist argument of the handler function. In Node.js HTTP Server, `args` is `[req, res]`, and `onRequest` defaults to `([req, res], done) => done(req))`.

#### Compatible request object

Sometimes, `IncomingMessage` is not available, when used in a non-Node.js environments like [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html) or [Deno](https://deno.land/), or when the framework does not expose it.

In such cases, you must create an object with the following properties:

- `headers`: **(Required)** A key-value object of the HTTP headers.
- `method`: **(Required)** The HTTP method verb (`GET`, `POST`, etc).
- `body`: The body of the request (object or string).

...with the additions of:

- `url`: The url of the request (path + query strings) so `graphyne-server` can parse `path` and `query` itself.

or supply it directly with:

- `path`: The path of the request (before query strings).
- `query`: The key-value object of the query strings.

### `onResponse(result, ...args)`

This is the function called to send back the HTTP response. It will be called with `args`, spreaded arguments of the framework handler function, and `result`, an object of:

- `status` (the status code that should be set)
- `headers` (the headers that should be set)
- `body` (the **stringified** response body).

By default, `onResponse` assumes `response` is the second argument of the handler function. In Node.js HTTP Server, `...args` is `req, res`, and `onResponse` defaults to `(result, req, res) => res.writeHead(result.status, result.headers).end(result.body)`.

### Integration examples

See [integrations.md](integrations.md).

## Additional features

Since some features are not used by everyone, they are not included by default to keep the package light-weight.

### Subscriptions

GraphQL subscriptions support is provided by [graphyne-ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphyne-ws) package. Check out the documentation [here](/packages/graphyne-ws).

### File uploads

To enable file upload, use [graphql-upload](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload) and add the `Upload` scaler. See [#10](https://github.com/hoangvvo/graphyne/issues/10).

### GraphQL Playground

You can use the packages from [graphql-playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground).

### Dataloader and N+1 Problem

A guide on how to integrate [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) to solve GraphQL N+1 Problem is covered in [#23](https://github.com/hoangvvo/graphyne/issues/23). Also check out an [example](/examples/with-dataloader).
