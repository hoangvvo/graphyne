# GraphQL WebSocket for Graphyne

The GraphQL WebSocket server to facilitate GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions over WebSocket. Implements [GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md).

This library is meant to be used exclusively with [Graphyne](/).

## Install

Install `graphyne-transport-ws` and [`graphql-subscriptions`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions) to use the PubSub system for subscriptions.

```shell
npm i graphyne-transport-ws graphql-subscriptions graphql
// or
yarn add graphyne-transport-ws graphql-subscriptions graphql
```

## Usage

[Example](/examples/with-graphql-subscriptions)

Creating an instance of `GraphyneWebSocketServer` is the same as in the popular [`ws`] library.

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const { GraphyneServer } = require('graphyne-server');
const { startSubscriptionServer } = require('graphyne-transport-ws');

// Create a GraphyneServer instance
const graphyne = new GraphyneServer(options);

const server = http.createServer(
  graphyne.createHandler()
);

// Hook it with graphyne-transport-ws
const wss = startSubscriptionServer({
  graphyne: graphyne, // Require an instance of Graphyne Server
  server: server, // Require an instance of HTTP Server
  path: '/graphql',
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at http://localhost:3000/graphql`);
});
```

To learn how to create a subscription as well as using different pubsub implementations (like Redis), see [graphql-subscriptions documentation](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions#getting-started-with-your-first-subscription).

## API

`GraphyneWebSocketServer` extends `WebSocket.Server`from [`ws`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) and thus inherits its [API](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/HEAD/doc/ws.md).

### startSubscriptionServer(options)

Create an instance of `GraphyneWebSocketServer` **and** listen to incoming connections automatically. The accepted options are the same as [`ws` options](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/HEAD/doc/ws.md#new-websocketserveroptions-callback), with the additions of:

- `graphyne`: (required) The instance of Graphyne Server to hook into.
- `context`: An object or function called to creates a context shared across resolvers per connection. The function receives an object with the following:
  - `connectionParams`: Object that is sent from the client. See an example in [`apollo-link-ws`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#authentication-over-websocket)
  - `socket`: The [WebSocket connection](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/HEAD/doc/ws.md#event-connection).
  - `request`: The incoming request.

A Node HTTP Server instance should be supplied to `options.server`.

### `new GraphyneWebSocketServer(options)`

Create a server instance of `GraphyneWebSocketServer` like in `startSubscriptionServer` without listening to connections. To listen to connections, listen to `connection` event like [this](https://github.com/hoangvvo/graphyne/blob/feat/subscription/packages/graphyne-transport-ws/src/graphyneWebsocket.ts#L232).

## Framework integration

### [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)

The HTTP Server instance is returned after `app.listen` is called.

```javascript
app.use(
  graphyne.createHandler({ /* ... */ })
);
const server = app.listen(PORT);

const wss = startSubscriptionServer({
  server: server,
  graphyne: graphyne,
  // other options
})
```

### [Micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro)

You need to [use Micro programmatically](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micro#programmatic-use) for WebSocket support. `micro()` returns a HTTP Server instance.

```javascript
const server = micro(
  graphyne.createHandler({ /* ... */ })
);

const wss = startSubscriptionServer({
  server: server,
  graphyne: graphyne,
  // other options
});
```
